The morning light filtered through the window,
casting long shadows across the wooden floor.
She reached for her coffee cup,
still warm from the fresh brew,
and took a slow sip while watching the world wake up outside.
Somewhere in the distance,
a dog barked twice and then fell silent,
leaving only the gentle hum of the refrigerator to fill the quiet kitchen.
