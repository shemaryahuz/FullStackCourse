# FullStackCourse

Welcome to the **FullStackCourse** repository! This repository follows my journey through a full stack development course. The structure is organized by topics and chapters, and is open for future expansion as I continue to learn and add more material. Each main topic is separated in its own directory, containing lessons, exercises, or project challenges.

> **Note:** The structure and content are a work in progress and will be updated over time. Some directories may be incomplete or expanded in the future.
